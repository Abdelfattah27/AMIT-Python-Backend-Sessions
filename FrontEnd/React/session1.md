          }
        };
        const fetchData = async () => {
          const loading = document.getElementById("loading");
          loading.style.display = "block";
          const data = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/postsss")
            .then((x) => x.json())
            .catch((error) => console.log(error));
          drawData(data);
          loading.style.display = "none";
        };
        const btn = document.getElementById("btn");
        btn.addEventListener("click", fetchData);

    </script>
```

### Basic thing before React

#### this

In JavaScript, the "this" keyword refers to the current object that the code is executing within. It allows functions to have access to the properties and methods of the object that they are a part of, and it can be used to make code more dynamic and reusable.

Here are two examples of how you can use "this" in JavaScript functions:

Example 1: Using "this" to access object properties

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  sayName: function () {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name);
  },
};

person.sayName(); // Output: "My name is John"

// 2
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  sayName() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name);
  }

  sayAge() {
    console.log("I am " + this.age + " years old");
  }
}

const person1 = new Person("John", 30);
const person2 = new Person("Jane", 25);

person1.sayName(); // Output: "My name is John"
person1.sayAge(); // Output: "I am 30 years old"

person2.sayName(); // Output: "My name is Jane"
person2.sayAge(); // Output: "I am 25 years old"
```

#### inheritance in js

```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name);
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
  }
}

const dog = new Dog("Rex");
dog.speak(); // Output: "Rex barks."
```

#### map

In JavaScript, the map() function is used to transform an array by applying a function to each element of the array. The map() function returns a new array that contains the transformed elements, leaving the original array unchanged.

The callback function that is passed to map() takes three parameters:

```javascript
arr.map(callback(currentValue, index, array));
```

currentValue - this is the current element being processed in the array.
index (optional) - this is the index of the current element being processed in the array.
array (optional) - this is the original array that map() was called upon.

```javascript
// 1
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(function (num) {
  return num * 2;
});

console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

// 2

const users = [
  { name: "John", age: 25 },
  { name: "Jane", age: 30 },
  { name: "Bob", age: 40 },
];

const names = users.map(function (user) {
  return user.name;
});

console.log(names); // Output: ['John', 'Jane', 'Bob']
```

#### filter

In JavaScript, the filter() function is a built-in method that allows you to iterate over an array and filter out elements based on a condition that you define. The filter() function returns a new array that only contains the elements that passed the condition.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(function (num) {
  return num % 2 === 0;
});

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4]
```

#### reduce

In JavaScript, the reduce() function is a built-in method that allows you to iterate over an array and reduce the array to a single value based on an accumulator function that you define. The reduce() function applies this function to each element of the array, and returns a single value that is the result of the reduction.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const sum = numbers.reduce(function (acc, num) {
  return acc + num;
});

console.log(sum); // Output: 15

// 2

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const sum = numbers.reduce(function (acc, num) {
  return acc + num;
}, 0);

console.log(sum); // Output: 15
```

#### object literals

In JavaScript, an object literal is a way of creating an object by directly specifying its properties and values within curly braces { }.

Here's an example:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  city: "New York",
};

console.log(person.name); // Output: John
console.log(person.age); // Output: 30
console.log(person.city); // Output: New York

// 2
const user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  address: {
    street: "123 Main St",
    city: "New York",
    state: "NY",
  },
  hobbies: ["reading", "traveling", "photography"],
};

console.log(user.address.city); // Output: New York
console.log(user.hobbies[1]); // Output: traveling
```

#### template literals

Template literals is a new way of defining strings in JavaScript that allows you to easily embed variables or expressions into a string. Template literals are defined using backticks (`) instead of single or double quotes.

Here's an example:

```javascript
const name = "John";
const age = 30;

const message = `My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;
console.log(multiLine);

const multiLine = `
  This is a
  multi-line
  string.
`;

console.log(message);
```

#### default parameter

In JavaScript, default parameters allow you to specify a default value for a function parameter in case no value or undefined is passed in when the function is called. This can be useful to provide a fallback value or to make a function more flexible.

Here's an example:

```javascript
function greet(name = "World") {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet(); // Output: Hello, World!
greet("John"); // Output: Hello, John!

function add(a, b = a * 2) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(add(1)); // Output: 3
console.log(add(1, 3)); // Output: 4
```

#### rest spread operator

In JavaScript, the rest and spread operators are used to work with arrays and objects.

The rest operator ... is used to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. It can be used in function arguments to collect all remaining arguments into an array. Here's an example:

```javascript
// rest
function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num);
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); // Output: 6
console.log(sum(4, 5, 6, 7)); // Output: 22

// spread
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const moreNumbers = [4, 5, 6];
const allNumbers = [...numbers, ...moreNumbers];

console.log(allNumbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

function greet(name, age, city) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}! You are ${age} years old and live in ${city}.`);
}

const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  city: "New York",
};

greet(...Object.values(person)); // Output: Hello, John! You are 30 years old and live in New York.
```

#### destructor assignment

n JavaScript, destructuring assignment is a way to extract values from objects and arrays into separate variables. It can be used to make code more concise and readable by allowing you to extract multiple values from an object or array in a single statement.

Destructuring assignment uses curly braces {} for objects and square brackets [] for arrays. Here's an example:

```javascript
// Object destructuring
const person = { name: "John", age: 30, city: "New York" };
const { name, age, city } = person;

console.log(name); // Output: John
console.log(age); // Output: 30
console.log(city); // Output: New York

// Array destructuring
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const [first, second, third] = numbers;

console.log(first); // Output: 1
console.log(second); // Output: 2
console.log(third); // Output: 3

// Object destructuring with default values and variable renaming
const person = { name: "John", age: 30 };
const { name: fullName = "Unknown", age: years } = person;

console.log(fullName); // Output: John
console.log(years); // Output: 30

// Array destructuring with default values and variable renaming
const numbers = [1, 2];
const [first, second = 0, third = 0] = numbers;

console.log(first); // Output: 1
console.log(second); // Output: 2
console.log(third); // Output: 0
```

## React?

React is a JavaScript library that allows developers to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces by creating reusable UI components. It follows a component-based architecture, which means you break down your UI into small, self-contained components that can be composed together to create complex user interfaces. React manages the rendering of these components efficiently, updating only the parts of the UI that change, which results in a fast and responsive user experience.

### Why use React?

#### Component-Based Development:

React promotes a modular and component-based approach to UI development. Each UI element is encapsulated within a component, making it easier to manage and reuse code.

#### Virtual DOM (Document Object Model):

React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering performance. Instead of directly manipulating the actual DOM, React updates a virtual representation of it. This minimizes DOM manipulation and improves application speed.

### Reusable Components:

React components are highly reusable. Once you create a component, you can use it in different parts of your application or even in multiple projects.

### Unidirectional Data Flow:
React enforces a unidirectional data flow, which makes it easier to track and manage data changes. Data flows in a single direction from parent to child components, simplifying the debugging process.

### Large Ecosystem and Community Support:

React has a vast ecosystem of libraries, tools, and community support. This means you can find solutions to common problems and easily integrate React into your tech stack.

### SEO-Friendly:

React can be used for server-side rendering (SSR), which improves search engine optimization (SEO) by ensuring that search engines can crawl and index your web pages more effectively.

### Progressive Web Apps (PWAs): 

React can be used to develop PWAs that offer a native app-like experience on the web, including offline access and push notifications.

### Cross-Platform Mobile Apps: 

With React Native, you can use React to build mobile applications that run on both iOS and Android devices, sharing a significant portion of the codebase.

### Cross-Platform Development:

React Native, a framework built on top of React, allows you to use React principles to develop mobile applications for both iOS and Android platforms.

## Examples of React in Action:

- Single-Page Applications (SPAs): React is commonly used to build SPAs where content dynamically updates without the need for full page reloads. Examples include Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.

- E-commerce Websites: React's ability to create reusable product components and efficiently handle complex UI interactions makes it ideal for building e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Airbnb.

- Dashboards and Data Visualization: React is great for creating interactive dashboards and data visualization tools. Libraries like D3.js can be combined with React to create stunning visualizations.

- Content Management Systems (CMS): React can be used to build the admin interfaces of CMS platforms, making it easier for content creators to manage and update content.


## compare between react and vanilla 
let's see with example : 
let's compare React and vanilla JavaScript by creating a simple counter component. We'll implement a counter that increments and decrements a value when a button is clicked.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Vanilla JS Counter</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Counter: <span id="counter">0</span></h1>
    <button id="incrementBtn">Increment</button>
    <button id="decrementBtn">Decrement</button>

    <script>
        // Get DOM elements
        const counterElement = document.getElementById('counter');
        const incrementBtn = document.getElementById('incrementBtn');
        const decrementBtn = document.getElementById('decrementBtn');

        // Initial counter value
        let counterValue = 0;

        // Update the counter value and display it
        function updateCounter() {
            counterElement.textContent = counterValue;
        }

        // Event listeners for buttons
        incrementBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
            counterValue++;
            updateCounter();
        });

        decrementBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
            counterValue--;
            updateCounter();
        });

        // Initial display
        updateCounter();
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Advantages of Vanilla JavaScript:

- Simplicity: 
    For simple tasks like this, vanilla JavaScript is straightforward and doesn't require additional setup.
- Lightweight:
    You don't need to include external libraries, making the code lightweight.

### Disadvantages:

1. Lack of Structure:
    As the application grows, managing state and UI updates becomes more complex and error-prone.
2. Limited Reusability:
    Reusing this code in other parts of the application or in different projects would require significant refactoring.


#### More Details about Disadvantages:
##### Reusability
- HTML Structure Dependency:
    The JavaScript code directly interacts with specific HTML elements, such as the counter display (```html <span id="counter"> ```) and buttons (```html <button id="incrementBtn" ```> and ```html <button id="decrementBtn">```). To reuse this code in another part of your application, you would need to ensure that these exact HTML elements exist in the new context, which is not always feasible or desirable.

- Global Variables: 
    The vanilla JavaScript example relies on global variables like counterValue to maintain the state of the counter. When reusing this code in another part of the application or in a different project, you risk conflicts with other global variables or unintended side effects.

- Event Listeners: 
    The event listeners are attached directly to specific HTML elements. To reuse the code, you would need to ensure that the new HTML elements have the same IDs (incrementBtn and decrementBtn) and follow the same structure, which can lead to code duplication and a lack of flexibility.

- Lack of Abstraction: 
    The code lacks a clear abstraction layer or encapsulation. Reusing this code would require duplicating the logic for managing the counter state and UI updates, leading to code duplication and maintenance issues.

Now, let's consider a scenario where you want to reuse the counter logic in a different part of your application or in a separate project. You might want to have multiple counters on a single page, each with its own state and behavior. With the vanilla JavaScript approach, you would need to:

- `Duplicate the HTML structure` and ensure that each counter has unique IDs.
- `Create separate global variables` to track the state of each counter.
- `Duplicate the event listeners` for each counter, modifying them to target the specific HTML elements associated with each counter.

This process can quickly become unwieldy and error-prone, especially as you add more counters or use the code in different projects with varying requirements.


### How react solve this problem

let's first install react 

To install React for your web development project, you need to set up a development environment that includes Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). React applications are typically created using a tool called Create React App, which simplifies the setup process. 

Here's a step-by-step guide to install React:

1. Step 1: Install Node.js and npm

React development requires Node.js and npm. You can download and install them from the [`official website`](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

After installation, you can check if Node.js and npm are installed correctly by running these commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
These commands should display the installed Node.js and npm versions.

2. Step 2: Create a React Application

The easiest way to create a React application is by using Create React App, a tool that sets up a new React project with a sensible default configuration. To create a new React app, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-react-app
```

This command will create a new directory called `my-react-app` with all the necessary files and dependencies for a React application.

3. Step 3: Navigate to Your React App's Directory

Once the app is created, navigate to the project directory using the cd command:

```bash
cd my-react-app
```

4. Step 4: Start the Development Server

You can start a development server to view your React application in your web browser. Run the following command within your project directory:
```bash
npm start
```
This will start the development server and open your React app in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000. You can edit your React code, and the changes will be automatically reflected in the browser.

#### What's create react app do ? 

- `Project Structure: CRA(create-react-app)` sets up a basic project structure for your React application. It creates a directory with all the necessary files and folders to organize your code.

- `Development Server`: It configures a development server that automatically reloads your application in the browser whenever you make changes to your code. This live reloading feature is incredibly useful for rapid development.

- `Babel and Webpack Configuration`: CRA configures Babel and Webpack for you, handling all the complex configuration details. This ensures that you can write modern JavaScript (including JSX syntax) and use the latest features without worrying about compatibility issues.

- `ESLint and Prettier`: It includes ESLint and Prettier for code linting and formatting. This helps maintain code consistency and catches potential errors early in development.

- `Optimized Production Build`: CRA comes with production build optimizations, such as minification, code splitting, and caching, to ensure your application is efficient and loads quickly for end-users.

- `Environment Variables`: It provides a way to define and use environment variables in your application, which is helpful for configuring different environments (development, production, testing).

- `Built-in Scripts`: CRA includes pre-defined npm scripts for common tasks like starting the development server (npm start), building the production-ready version of your app (npm run build), and running tests (npm test).

- `Development Dependencies`: It installs and manages development dependencies like React, ReactDOM, and other tools needed for React development.

by running a single command like npx create-react-app my-app, Create React App sets up all of these configurations and tools for you. This allows developers to focus on writing React components and building their applications rather than spending time on initial project setup and configuration.


### React File Structure 
```java 
my-app/
  ├── node_modules/
  ├── public/
  │    ├── index.html
  │    ├── manifest.json
  │    └── favicon.ico
  ├── src/
  │    ├── App.js
  │    ├── index.js
  │    ├── logo.svg
  │    ├── serviceWorker.js
  │    └── setupTests.js
  ├── package.json
  ├── README.md
  ├── .gitignore
  ├── .env
  ├── .eslintrc.json
  └── .prettierrc
```


- `node_modules/`: This directory contains all the dependencies and packages installed for your project. It's managed by npm or yarn and should not be modified manually.

- `public/`: This directory contains static assets and the HTML template for your application.
  - `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for your React application. It includes a `<div id="root">` where your React app will be mounted.
  - `manifest.json`: A JSON file that provides metadata about your web application, such as its name and icons for home screen installation.
  - `favicon.ico`: The icon that appears in the browser's tab when your app is open.

- `src/`: This directory contains your application's source code.
  - `App.js`: The main React component of your application. This is where your app's structure and layout are defined.
  - `index.js`: The entry point of your application. It renders the `App` component and mounts it to the DOM.
  - `logo.svg`: An example SVG image that can be used in your application.
  - `serviceWorker.js`: A file that sets up a service worker for progressive web app (PWA) functionality. It can cache assets for offline use and improve performance.
  - `setupTests.js`: Configuration file for setting up testing libraries and utilities.

- `package.json`: A JSON file that defines your project's metadata, dependencies, and scripts. It's used by npm to manage project dependencies and scripts.

- `README.md`: A documentation file that provides information about your project, including how to set it up and use it.

- `.gitignore`: A file that specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git. It typically includes `node_modules/` and build-related directories.

- `.env`: An environment configuration file that allows you to define environment variables for your project. These variables can be accessed in your code using `process.env`.

- `.eslintrc.json`: Configuration file for ESLint, a tool for code linting. It defines coding style rules and helps catch potential errors in your JavaScript code.

- `.prettierrc`: Configuration file for Prettier, a code formatter. It defines code formatting rules to maintain consistent code style.

#### how react solve the problem of the Counter and reusability 

creating a simple counter component. We'll implement a counter that increments and decrements a value when a button is clicked.


```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  const decrement = () => {
    setCount(count - 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;

```
#### how to Reuse this 

Let's consider a scenario where you have a React application with multiple pages or views, and you want to reuse the Counter component across these different pages. 


Suppose you have a project structure like this:

```css
src/
  components/
    Counter.js
  pages/
    Home.js
    About.js
```

```js
// Counter.js

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter({ initialValue = 0, step = 1 }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + step);
  };

  const decrement = () => {
    setCount(count - step);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

```js

// Home.js 

import React from 'react';
import Counter from '../components/Counter';

function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Home Page</h2>
      <Counter initialValue={5} step={2} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default Home;

```

```js
// About.js
import React from 'react';
import Counter from '../components/Counter';

function About() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>About Page</h2>
      <Counter initialValue={10} step={3} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default About;

```


The Counter component is defined in a separate file (Counter.js) and is reusable.
The Home and About pages both import and use the Counter component.

Each page customizes the Counter component by providing different initialValue and step props. For example, the Home page uses a counter with an initial value of 5 and a step of 2, while the About page uses a counter with an initial value of 10 and a step of 3.

This way, you can reuse the Counter component across different pages within the same project, and each page can have its own customized version of the counter. 

This demonstrates how component reusability in React allows you to maintain consistent functionality while tailoring the appearance and behavior of components to fit the needs of different parts of your application.
