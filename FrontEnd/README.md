# AMIT-frontend-Bootcamp

This repo contains two folders: JS, React.
Each folder has its own documentation of the respective topic. The documentation is divided into several markdown (md) files, with each md file covering the content explained in a particular session.

In addition, each folder also has a file called Tasks.md that contains the solved tasks in each session, helping the user to practice and apply what they have learned.

This repo is useful for anyone who wants to learn react programming.
By studying the content and completing the tasks, users can gain a solid understanding of these topics and apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios.
